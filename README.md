# Computer Graphics (CSE 160) Projects

This repository contains my projects for Computer Graphics (CSE 160), a course exploring fundamental concepts in computer graphics through progressive hands-on assignments.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 0: Vector Mathematics
- Implemented a vector class with essential operations
- Built foundation for mathematical operations used in computer graphics
- Practiced with vector operations, dot products, cross products, and transformations

### Assignment 1: Drawing with Triangles
- Created 2D graphics using WebGL
- Implemented primitive drawing using triangles as building blocks
- Explored vertex manipulation and basic shape creation
- Applied color and position transformations

### Assignment 2: Blocky Animal
- Designed and constructed a 3D animal model using cubes
- Implemented hierarchical transformations to create complex structures
- Added animation capabilities to bring the model to life
- Applied textures and colors to enhance visual appearance

### Assignment 3: Blocky World
- Built an interactive 3D environment using WebGL
- Implemented navigation controls (WASD, QE) for movement
- Created a first-person camera with mouse look functionality
- Added block placement and removal mechanics
- Developed collision detection for realistic exploration

### Assignment 4: Lighting and Rendering
- Enhanced the blocky world with lighting effects
- Implemented various light types (directional, point, ambient)
- Added shadows for improved visual fidelity
- Created primitive sphere objects with proper lighting response
- Applied shading algorithms to improve realism

### Assignment 5: Three.js Scene
- Transitioned from raw WebGL to the Three.js library
- Created a complex 3D scene with multiple object types
- Implemented various material types and textures
- Added multiple light sources (ambient, directional, point, hemisphere, spot, rectArea)
- Incorporated camera controls for scene navigation
- Loaded and displayed external 3D models (GLB/GLTF format)
- Created particle effects and animations
- Built an interactive "CLASS OF 2025" celebration feature

## Technologies Used
- WebGL
- JavaScript
- Three.js
- GLSL Shaders
- HTML/CSS

## Key Concepts Learned
- 3D Mathematics and Transformations
- Rendering Pipelines
- Shader Programming
- Lighting Models
- Texture Mapping
- Camera Controls and Perspective
- Animation Techniques
- Interactive Graphics Programming
- Scene Graph Management
- External Model Loading and Manipulation

## Project Structure
Each assignment is contained in its own directory with the necessary files, libraries, and resources. Assignment instructions and requirements can be found within each folder.

## Running the Projects
Most assignments can be viewed by opening the corresponding HTML file in a modern web browser. Some assignments may require a local server to handle resource loading (especially for texture loading and model imports).
